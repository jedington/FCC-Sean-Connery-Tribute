    <h3 id="headline">A short timeline of Sir Connery's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1930</strong> - Born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Named Thomas after his father.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1944</strong> - Connery's first job was as a milkman in Edinburgh with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071013215418/http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=2275262005" target="_blank"> St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society</a> on July 20, 1944, at the age of 14.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946</strong> - He then joined the Royal Navy at 16, where he acquired two tattoos; the tattoos reflected two of his lifelong commitments: Family and Scotland. He trained in Portsmouth at the naval gunnery school and in an anti-aircraft crew. He was then assigned as an Able Seaman on HMS Formidable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1949</strong> - Connery was later discharged from the navy at the age of 19 on medical grounds because of a duodenal ulcer, a condition that affected most of the males in previous generations of his family.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1951</strong> - Seeking to supplement his income, Connery helped out backstage at the King's Theatre. While in Edinburgh, Connery was targeted by the Valdor gang, one of the most violent in the city. He was first approached by them in a billiard hall where he prevented them from stealing his jacket and was later followed by six gang members to a 15-foot-high balcony at the Palais de Danse. There, Connery singlehandedly launched an attack against the gang members, grabbing one by the throat and another by a biceps and cracked their heads together. From then on, he was treated with great respect by the gang and gained a reputation as a "hard man".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - During a bodybuilding competition held in London, one of the competitors mentioned that auditions were being held for a production of South Pacific, and Connery landed a small part as one of the Seabees chorus boys. By the time the production reached Edinburgh, he had been given the part of Marine Cpl. Hamilton Steeves and was understudying two of the juvenile leads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953~1956</strong> - Although Connery had secured several roles as extras, he was struggling to make ends meet, and was forced to accept a part-time job as a babysitter for journalist Peter Noble and his actress wife Marianne. Around this time, Connery was residing at TV presenter Llew Gardner's house.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1957~1961</strong> - Connery hired agent Richard Hatton who got him his first film role, as Spike, a minor gangster with a speech impediment in Montgomery Tully's No Road Back. In April, he was given his first chance in a leading role, and cast as Mountain McLintock in BBC Television's production of Requiem for a Heavyweight. He went on to play other leading and support roles, but nothing truly significant until 1961 rolled around.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1962~1967</strong> - Connery's breakthrough came in the role of British secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded, his career would greatly benefit. Between 1962 and 1967, Connery played 007 in Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, and You Only Live Twice, the first five Bond films produced by Eon Productions. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer Albert Broccoli. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks," and "I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man", adding that Connery was unrefined. Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No première. He was so impressed, he wrote Connery's heritage into the character. In his 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, Fleming wrote that Bond's father was Scottish and from Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands. Although Bond had made him a star, Connery grew tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying "[I am] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit" and "I have always hated that damned James Bond. I'd like to kill him". While making the Bond films, Connery also starred in other films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964) and Sidney Lumet's The Hill (1965), which film critic Peter Bradshaw regards as his two great non-Bond pictures from the 1960s.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1975-1976</strong> - He appeared in John Huston's The Man Who Would Be King (1975) opposite Michael Caine, who would come to be one of Connery's closest of friends. Playing two former British soldiers who set themselves up as Kings in Kafiristan, both actors regarded it as their favourite film. The same year, he appeared in The Wind and the Lion opposite Candice Bergen who played Eden Pedecaris (based on the real-life Perdicaris incident), and in 1976 played Robin Hood in Robin and Marian opposite Audrey Hepburn, who played Maid Marian. Film critic Roger Ebert, who had praised the double act of Connery and Caine in The Man Who Would Be King, praised Connery's chemistry with Hepburn, writing: "Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1983</strong> - Connery agreed to reprise Bond as an aging agent 007 in Never Say Never Again, released in October 1983. The title, contributed by his wife, refers to his earlier statement that he would "never again" return to the role. Although the film performed well at the box office, it was plagued with production problems: strife between the director and producer, financial problems, the Fleming estate trustees' attempts to halt the film, and Connery's wrist being broken by fight choreographer, Steven Seagal. As a result of his negative experiences during filming, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and did not make any films for two years. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1986~1989</strong> - Following the successful European production The Name of the Rose (1986), for which he won a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, Connery's interest in more commercial material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in Highlander showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which became a recurring role in many of his later films. In 1987, Connery starred in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, where he played a hard-nosed Irish-American cop alongside Kevin Costner's Eliot Ness. The film was a critical and box office success. Many critics praised Connery for his performance including Roger Ebert who wrote "The best performance in the movie is Connery ... [he] brings a human element to his character; he seems to have had an existence apart from the legend of the Untouchables, and when he's onscreen we can believe, briefly, that the Prohibition Era was inhabited by people, not caricatures". For his performance, Connery received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Connery starred in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), playing Henry Jones, Sr., the title character's father, and received BAFTA and Golden Globe Award nominations. Harrison Ford said Connery's contributions at the writing stage enhanced the film. "It was amazing for me in how far he got into the script and went after exploiting opportunities for character. His suggestions to George [Lucas] at the writing stage really gave the character and the picture a lot more complexity and value than it had in the original screenplay".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1990~1999</strong> - Connery's subsequent box-office hits included The Hunt for Red October (1990), The Russia House (1990), The Rock (1996), and Entrapment (1999). In 1996, he voiced the role of Draco the dragon in the film Dragonheart. He also appeared in a brief cameo as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991). In 1998, Connery received the BAFTA Fellowship, a lifetime achievement award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Connery turned down the role of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings films, saying he did not understand the script. He was reportedly offered $30 million along with 15% of the worldwide box office receipts, which would have earned him $450 million. He also turned down the opportunity to appear as the Architect in The Matrix trilogy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2000</strong> - Connery was knighted by the Queen at an investiture ceremony at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 5 July 2000. He had been nominated for a knighthood in 1997 and 1998, but these nominations were reported to have been vetoed by Donald Dewar owing to Connery's political views. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2000~2005</strong> - Connery received positive reviews for his performance in Finding Forrester (2000). He also received a Crystal Globe for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. In a 2003 UK poll conducted by Channel 4, Connery was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars. The failure of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) was especially frustrating for Connery. He sensed during shooting that the production was "going off the rails", and announced that the director, Stephen Norrington should be "locked up for insanity". Connery spent considerable effort in trying to salvage the film through the editing process, ultimately deciding to retire from acting rather than go through such stress ever again. In 2005, he recorded voiceovers for the From Russia with Love video game with recording producer Terry Manning in The Bahamas, and provided his likeness. Connery said he was happy the producers, Electronic Arts, had approached him to voice Bond.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020</strong> - Connery died in his sleep on 31 October 2020, aged 90, at his home in the Lyford Cay community of Nassau in The Bahamas. His death was announced by his family and Eon Productions; although they did not disclose the cause of death, his son Jason said he had been unwell for some time. A day later, Connery's wife Micheline Roquebrune said he had dementia in his final years. Connery's death certificate was obtained by TMZ a month after his death, showing that he died of pneumonia and heart failure.

        <strong>A separate tribute from Daniel Craig</strong> - “It is with such sadness that I heard of the passing of one of the true greats of cinema. Sir Sean Connery will be remembered as Bond and so much more. He defined an era and a style. The wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in mega watts; he helped create the modern blockbuster. He will continue to influence actors and film-makers alike for years to come. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course.”
